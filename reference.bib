 abstract={This paper presents the operational issues and results of implementing realtime headwaybased reliability control along candidate bus routes operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority in 1987. The procedure involves holding buses at a control point on the route until a prescribed minimum headway is achieved. Headwaybased control strategies apply to highfrequency transit routes where headways are sufficiently short that travelers arrive randomly at bus stops without consulting a schedule. It is considered appropriate for correcting service disruptions that have already occurred, or for preventing propagation and further service degradation. The goal of this effort is to improve service reliability as perceived by travelers, as well as to allow for more effective utilization of operator resources. Failure by street supervisors to consistently follow holding instructions and data collection problems involving point checkers hampered the evaluation effort. Nevertheless, it appears that certain routes may benefit from holding actions. Where these improvements are measurable, dramatic operator savings, due to reduced vehicle requirements, may be realized. This depends on the extent to which passenger load, relative to vehicle capacity, may preclude the operator from taking maximum advantage of the derived service benefits.},

 abstract={Holding is one of the most commonly used real-time control strategies in transit operations. Given a transit network and its operations plan, the holding problem is to decide at a given time at a control station, which vehicle is to be held and for how long, such that the total passenger cost along the route is minimized over a time period. Previous research on the holding problem has always assumed no real-time information available. Such an assumption not only poses great difficulties in solving the problem, but also limits practical applications in a real-time, dynamic operations environment. In this paper we formulate the holding problem as a deterministic quadratic program in a rolling horizon scheme, and develop an efficient solution algorithm to solve it. Using headway data collected by an automated system, we tested the algorithm and evaluated the impact of the resulting holding policies. Important and interesting properties of the holding solution, obtained from both theoretical and computational analyses, are presented.},

 abstract={As a departure from previous studies on the stop-skipping control problem, this study investigates the possibility of implementing a stop-skipping policy for operations control in a real-time manner. Stop-skipping is investigated for a service disruption of varying length, occurring in the middle of a route, as a means of responding to the disruption more rapidly. Based on a preliminary analysis that shows that a basic stop-skipping policy may not be appropriate for real-time application, a policy alternative is constructed such that the control vehicle can still drop off passengers at stops in the skipping segment. The stop-skipping strategy is formulated separately for both policies as a nonlinear integer programming problem. The problem formulation includes assumptions of random distributions of passenger boardings and alightings, specifically with the binomial distribution and Poisson distribution representing the passenger alighting and boarding processes, respectively. The problem solution uses an exhaustive search method by taking advantage of the relatively small scale of the problem. A simulation study is conducted to examine how the performance of the two stop-skipping policies changes with the passenger distribution pattern, the service disruption location, the disruption length, as well as the vehicle travel time variability on the route. These simulation results suggest that both policies are not very sensitive to the travel time variability individually, when compared to other major factors. However, the travel time variability could contribute significantly to the difference in performance of the two policies because it affects the performance of the two policies in opposite ways. For both normal and downtown-oriented passenger distribution patterns, both policies perform similarly in terms of total passenger waiting time reduction for a majority of cases. However, a significant difference in the performance of the two polices can still be seen for a large percentage of cases under varying circumstances. These results suggest that the downtown-oriented passenger distribution pattern may present the most desirable condition for the policy alternative. For the reverse-direction passenger distribution pattern, the policy alternative rarely outperforms the basic policy due to the inherent dynamics of the policy itself.},

abstract = {This paper presents a first approach to dynamic frequency-based transit assignment. As such the model aims to close the gap between schedule-based and frequency-based models. Frequency-based approaches have some advantages compared to schedule-based models, however, when modelling highly congested networks a static frequency-based approach is not sufficient as it does not reveal the peaked nature of the capacity problem. The central idea for dealing with the line capacity constraints is the introduction of a "fail-to-board" probability as in some circumstances passengers are not able to board the first service arriving due to overcrowding. The common line problem is taken into account and the search for the shortest hyperpath is influenced by the fail-to-board probability. An assumption that passengers mingle on the platform allows a Markov network loading process which respects the priority of on-board passengers with respect to those wishing to board. The study period is divided into several time intervals and those passengers who failed to board are added to the demand in the subsequent time interval and so might reconsider their route choice. Trips that are longer than one interval are also carried over to subsequent time intervals. The approach is first illustrated with a small example network and then with a case study relating to London, where transit capacity problems are experienced daily during the peak period. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract={Schedule-based or headway-based control schemes to reduce bus bunching are not resilient because they cannot prevent buses from losing ground to the buses they follow when disruptions increase the gaps separating them beyond a critical value. (Following buses are then overwhelmed with passengers and cannot process their work quick enough to catch up.) This critical gap problem can be avoided, however, if buses at the leading end of such gaps are given information to cooperate with the ones behind by slowing down. This paper builds on this idea. It proposes an adaptive control scheme that adjusts a bus cruising speed in real-time based on both, its front and rear spacings much as if successive bus pairs were connected by springs. The scheme is shown to yield regular headways with faster bus travel than existing control methods. Its simple and decentralized logic automatically compensates for traffic disruptions and inaccurate bus driver actions. Its hardware and data requirements are minimal.},

 abstract={As is well known, bus systems are naturally unstable. Without control, buses on a single line tend to bunch, reducing their punctuality in meeting a schedule. Although conventional schedule-based strategies that hold buses at control points can alleviate this problem these methods require too much slack, which slows buses. This delays on-board passengers and increases operating costs. It is shown that dynamic holding strategies based on headways alone cannot help buses adhere to a schedule. Therefore, a family of dynamic holding strategies that use bus arrival deviations from a virtual schedule at the control points is proposed. The virtual schedule is introduced whether the system is run with a published schedule or not. It is shown that with this approach, buses can both closely adhere to a published schedule and maintain regular headways without too much slack. A one-parameter version of the method can be optimized in closed form. This simple method is shown to be near-optimal. To put it in practice, the only data needed in real time are the arrival times of the current bus and the preceding bus at the control point relative to the virtual schedule. The simple method was found to require about 40% less slack than the conventional schedule-based method. When used only to regulate headways it outperforms headway-based methods.},

 abstract={The primary challenge for an urban bus system is to maintain constant headways between successive buses. Most bus systems try to achieve this by adherence to a schedule; but this is undermined by the tendency of headways to collapse, so that buses travel in bunches. To counter this, we propose a new method of cordinating buses. Our method abandons the idea of a schedule and even any a priori target headway. Under our scheme headways are dynamically self-equalizing and the natural headway of the system tends to emerge spontaneously. Headways also become self-correcting in that after disturbances they requalize without intervention by management or even awareness of the drivers. We report on a successful implementation to control a bus route in Atlanta.},

 abstract={Transit operators are interested in strategies to improve service reliability as it is an important measure of performance and level of service. One of the common practices aimed to reduce service unreliability is holding control strategies. The design of these strategies involves the selection of a set of time point stops and the holding criteria for regulating the departure time. In order to analyze the impacts of holding strategies on transit performance, it is necessary to model dynamically the interactions between passenger activity, transit operations and traffic dynamics. An evaluation of different holding criteria and number and location of time point stops was conducted using BusMezzo, a dynamic transit simulation model. The holding strategies were implemented in the model and applied to a high frequency trunk bus line in Stockholm. The analysis of the results considers the implications of holding strategies from both passengers and operator perspectives. The analysis suggests substantial gains from implementing holding strategy based on the mean headway from the preceding bus and the succeeding bus. This strategy is the most efficient in terms of passenger time savings as well as fleet costs and crew management.},

 abstract={In this paper a novel variational inequality (VI) formulation of the dynamic user optimal (DUO) route choice problem is proposed using the concept of approach proportion. An approach proportion represents the proportion of travelers that select a turning or through movement when leaving a node. Approach proportions contain travelers' route information so that the realistic effects of physical queues can be captured in a formulation when a physical-queue traffic flow model is adopted, and so that route enumeration and path-set generation can be avoided in the solution procedure. In addition, the simple structure of the approach proportion representation allows us to decompose the constraint set for solving large-scale DUO route choice problems. This paper also discusses the existence and uniqueness of the solutions to the VI problem and develops a solution algorithm based on the extragradient method to solve the proposed VI problem. This solution algorithm makes use of the decomposition property of the constraint set and is convergent if the travel time functions are pseudomonotone and Lipschitz continuous. It is not necessary to know the Lipschitz constant of the travel time functions in advance. Finally, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the properties of the proposed model and the performance of the solution algorithm.},

Unlike the existing methods for solving the frequency-based transit assignment problem, the convergence of our method requires only the pseudomonotone and Lipschitz continuous properties of the mapping function in VI, and it is not necessary for the Lipschitz constant to be known in advance. A Braess-like paradox in transit assignment is also discussed, where providing new lines to a transit network or increasing the frequency of an existing line may not improve the system performance in terms of expected total system travel cost.

Both methodologies solve the same problem, the former based on a deterministic optimization over a long-term rolling horizon, while the latter proposes a hybrid predictive approach considering a shorter horizon and a stochastic evolution of the system. The comparison is conducted through scenarios that include three different dimensions: (i) bus capacities which can be reached or not, (ii) service frequencies, considering high and medium frequency services and (iii) different load profiles along the corridor. The results show that the deterministic approach performs better under scenarios where bus capacity could be reached frequently along the route while the hybrid predictive control approach performs better in situations where this does not happen.},

 abstract={This paper proposes a dynamic control method to overcome bunching and improve the regularity of fixed-route transit systems. The method uses a combination of dynamic holding and en-route driver guidance to achieve its objectives. It applies to systems with a mix of headway-based and schedule-based lines but it is evaluated for scheduled systems as this is the more challenging application. Improved schedule adherence is the goal. The method's calculation complexity per piece of advice does not increase with system size. As a result, the method is scalable and can be used with large multi-line systems, no matter how complex. When controlled, each vehicle is mostly affected by exogenous disturbances (e.g. traffic) and very little by other vehicles. As a result, disruptions to a vehicle or group of vehicles caused by inattentive drivers or control equipment failures remain confined to the vehicles experiencing the problems. The control method effectively quarantines "disease". The method is evaluated analytically and with simulations over a broad range of conditions, including schedules with zero slack. The method was also evaluated by observing the performance of a real world multi-line system that uses inexpensive on-board tablets to apply the control. The evaluation addresses driver compliance and equipment malfunction issues. It is found that the method is resilient and improves reliability considerably even under challenging conditions.},

The model can be used to produce a plan of holding times that accounts not only for the current state of the system, but also for expected changes in running times and demand. We evaluate the effectiveness of the model within a simulation environment.

 abstract={Bus headways are typically susceptible to external disturbances (e.g., due to traffic congestion, clustered passenger arrivals, and special passenger needs), which create gaps in the system that grow eventually into bunching. Although many control strategies, such as static and dynamic holding strategies, have been implemented to mitigate the effects of unreliable bus schedules, most of them would impose longer dwell times on the passengers. In this paper, we investigate the potential of an alternative bus substitution strategy that is currently implemented by some transit agencies in an ad-hoc manner. In this strategy, the agency deploys a fleet of standby buses to take over service from any early or late buses so as to contain deviations from schedule, and the intention is to impose minimum penalties on the onboard passengers. We develop a discrete-time infinite-horizon approximate dynamic programming approach to find the optimal policy to minimize the overall agency and passenger costs. It is shown through numerical examples that schedule deviations can be controlled by regularly inserting standby buses as substitutions. In some implementation scenarios, the proposed strategy holds the potential to achieve comparable performance with some of the most advanced strategies, and to outperform the conventional slack-based schedule control scheme. In light of the emerging opportunities associated with autonomous driving, the performance of the proposed strategy can become even stronger due to the reduction in costs for keeping the fleet of standby buses.},

 abstract={Traditional bus bunching control methods (e.g., adding slack to schedules, adapting cruising speed), in one way or another, trade commercial speed for better system stability and, as a result, may impose the burden of additional travel time on passengers. Recently, a dynamic bus substitution strategy, where standby buses are dispatched to take over service from late/early buses, was proposed as an attempt to enhance system reliability without sacrificing too much passenger experience. This paper further studies this substitution strategy in the context of multiple bus lines under either time-independent or time-varying settings. In the latter scenario, the fleet of standby buses can be dynamically utilized to save on opportunity costs. We model the agency's substitution decisions and retired bus repositioning decisions as a stochastic dynamic program so as to obtain the optimal policy that minimizes the system-wide costs. Numerical results show that the dynamic substitution strategy can benefit from the "economies of scale" by pooling the standby fleet across lines, and there are also benefits from dynamic fleet management when transit demand varies over time. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the applicability and advantage of the proposed strategy. The substitution strategy not only holds the promise to outperform traditional holding methods in terms of reducing passenger costs, they also can be used to complement other methods to better control very unstable systems.},

Furthermore, we formulate a nonlinear optimal control problem to design the robust optimal bus control, which not only reduces the bus bunching, but also improves the schedule adherence and headway regularity of bus service lines. To handle the complexity of the nonlinear optimal control problem with uncertain parameters and disturbances, we reduce it to a convex optimization problem by the minimization of an upper bound on the objective function. The problem is solved in a polynomial time and satisfies the practical real time requirement. Numerical examples are presented to validate the effectiveness of the model and control methods.},

To efficiently incorporate global coordination and long-term operation in bus holding, in this paper we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MDRL) framework to develop dynamic and flexible holding control strategies for a bus route. Specifically, we model each bus as an agent that interacts with not only its leader/follower but also all other vehicles in the fleet. To better explore potential strategies, we develop an effective headway-based reward function in the proposed framework. In the learning framework, we model fleet coordination by using a basic actor-critic scheme along with a joint action tracker to better characterize the complex interactions among agents in policy learning, and we apply proximal policy optimization to improve learning performance. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to evaluate the proposed MDRL framework against multiple baseline models that only rely on local information. Our results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework and show the promise of applying MDRL in the coordinative control of public transport vehicle fleets in real-world operations.},
